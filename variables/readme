A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory.
Variable is a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program.
A variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using variable "name".
In Python, we do not have to explicitly define the variable type like C.
Ex :- In C,
      int x; //To declare a variable
      x = 5; //To define a variable
      But in Python,
      x = 5 #No need to declare the type of variable, Python automatically recognizes what type of data is assigned.

Rules for variable names :-
->Python variables must begin with letter(upper case or lower case) or an underscore(_).
Ex :- greet = "hi"
      num = 33
      _num = 24
->They can contain letters, numbers or _ but cannot begin with a number.
Ex :- 3num = 21 #It will be an error
      num2 = 12 #It will be fine
->Python variables are case sensitive.
Ex :- Num = 5
      num = 5
      Both Num and num are different variables.
->Variables are created when they are attached to a value using '=' sign.
Ex :- a = 3 #Variable a is created and assigned value 3 to it.
