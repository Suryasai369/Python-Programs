* Python is both structural and object oriented programming language.
->Structural Programming : It is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive 
use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), and block structures.
->Object Oriented Programming : It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. Data in the form of 
fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
* Python is an interpreted language.
->Intepreted Language : An interpreted language is a programming language which are generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions.
It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program
*Features Of python :
->Cross platform compatible : Python code written in on one operating system can run on other Python installed operating systems too which is also konwn as platform 
independent.
->Ineractive : Python can be easily understood by the users as it is easily readable.
->Open Source : Python code is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.
*Disadvantages of Python:
Due to interpreted language, python is slower than compiled languages like java,c,c++ etc.,
